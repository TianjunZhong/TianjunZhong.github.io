I am Tianjun Zhong, a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research focuses on **understanding and enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs)**, with broader interests in **interpretability, reliability, and agentic systems**.

My work spans several directions: investigating the mechanisms that underlie reasoning in LLMs, developing methods to improve interpretability and layer-wise understanding, building collaborative agentic systems for complex tasks, and advancing approaches to post-training that preserve reliability at scale. These efforts aim to deepen our scientific understanding of model internals while creating practical systems that are efficient and trustworthy.

I have had the opportunity to collaborate with [Professor Nima Mesgarani](https://nima.ee.columbia.edu/) (Columbia) on bridging reasoning in LLMs with human neural activity, [Professor Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) (UC San Diego) on large-scale post-training and reinforcement learning for reasoning, and [Professor Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/) (Columbia) on designing multi-agent systems for software engineering. Together, these experiences shape my broader interest in aligning LLM development with both interpretability and real-world deployment.
